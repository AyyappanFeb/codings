Flume consist of 4 main things :

Source - which is getting input from external sources and loading into Channel
Channel - Which ensures the flow of event from source to sink 
Sink - Which gets the event from the channel and load into the storage device
Event - The datablocks which flows from souce to sink via channel
Agent - Combination of souce --> channel --> Sink

only one thing which we need to perform in flume is - 'configuring' (configuration of souce, channel, sink)

There are various types of source, channel and sink

Various types of channel in flume is :

  * Memory channel (non-reliable, fast, widely used, in-memory)
  * File Channel (very reliable, average, widely used, file-system)
  * Kafka channel
  * JDBC Channel
  * Spillable memory channel
  * Pseudo transistion channel
  * Custom channel
